TODO
====

- Check DPDK initialization: constants have been randomly used everywhere. We
  need to check they are optimal and ideally configurable.
- Return ICMP response if TTL is exceeded.
- Improve CLI (auto-completion, select loop).
- Handle #include directive in configuration.
- Add cond_vlan.
